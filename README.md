## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- location maps into the projects made easy through leaflet.js

-use of html's picture element for the browser to chose the right image for the right device.

### Continued development

-Used picture element as well as use of leafletJs with react.

### Useful resources

- [picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This helped me for displaying of the images dynamically by the browser. I plan to keep on using it from now onwards
- [leaflet.js](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This is an amazing resource when it comes to pinpoint the location. It is very easy to use and I am looking forward to keep learning how to even customise it. I'd recommend it to anyone still wanting to implement locations and maps into their projects.
